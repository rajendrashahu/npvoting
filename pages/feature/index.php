            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                The backstory of this invention takes us back to 2010/2011 and a piece of specific news printed in the Kantipur. It reported a difficult situation for the Election Commission, Nepal, over their hasty purchase of an Electronic Voting Machine(EVM) from India in 2011. EVMs were introduced to Indian elections in 1998 and early 2000 in phases after testing throughout the 90s. Election Commission, Nepal tried to follow their Indian counterparts in reducing the fraudulent activity and extravagant expenses with the use of EVMs. But without proper planning and foresight, this move backfired massively. Nepali public and election officials found adjusting to this sudden change difficult, while the credibility of its results also raised some eyebrows. At the same time, the political parties had almost doubled from 64 to 125 in 5 years. Election Commission, Nepal was stuck with an expensive outdated machine. Upon RL Innovations' closer inspection, they discovered that the machine was using primitive technology.

                This motivated RL Innovations to develop their version of the voting machine with a user-friendly interface. They have been working on voting machines for the last decade and have spent millions of Nepali rupees perfecting this device. They have successfully conducted over 100 elections for political parties, NRN, Jaycees, banks, schools, financial institutes and other organizations. They are currently working on the fifth iteration of a voting machine specifically designed for national elections. Unlike the imported voting machine, their invention gives the government flexibility to customize the screen size. It is simple to operate and easy to use. RL Innovations is confident of bringing an electoral reform in Nepal with this voting machine.
